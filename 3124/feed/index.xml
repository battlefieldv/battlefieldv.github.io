					<description><![CDATA[This is very helpful in that map for pilots. The visibility from air to ground is probably the worst. Given how Air combat heavy the map is, I suspect that Dice did this so that it won&#039;t turn into another Fjell situation .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The fact that you spotted him is probably the only reason the pilot found him. Something is wrong with view distance in this game, light vehicles like Puma/Greyhounds are invisible from the air in the third person. You have to swap to first-person zoom scope for them to suddenly pop out, and they vanish again the instant you zoom out and ready your bombsight.

Most pilots I speak to has this issue, so I am pretty sure its not just me.]]></description>
