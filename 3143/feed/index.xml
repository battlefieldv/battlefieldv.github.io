					<description><![CDATA[The game makes a weak attempt at evening teams right at the end of the round, before players are even able to disconnect from the server and a full minute before the beginning of the next round.

After this no other balancing efforts take place, so the game will happily start the match even with 32v0.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[EA made it so third party server control software would no longer work in BF games beginning with BF1.  So all the various balance plug-ins available for server operators up to BF4 don&#039;t work in BF1 or BFV--of course BFV also lacks rented servers.

Brilliant move, one of EA&#039;s best.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Funny how DICE was intelligent enough to have autobalancing 15 years ago when BF2 came out and then as time went on they went dumb and forgot how to make it work. 

This crap made me quit playing, half of the rounds I was in were so hilariously lopsided. Like, I want to play 32v32, not the entire US military vs goddamn New Guinea.]]></description>
