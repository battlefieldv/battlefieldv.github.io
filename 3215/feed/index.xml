					<description><![CDATA[The only thing they got wrong is the ingame description of the rifle.   But that certainly wasn’t BFV’s strong suit anyway. (Coming from the brilliant BF1) 

P.S excellent video! Very entertaining stuff]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This video covers the brief history, function and shooting versus its depiction in BFV. 

Definitely the last one of these I’m making for this game because it’s on its way out in the wake of BF2042, but I just wanted to make an IRL comparison to the Krag from recon class before the new one empties the servers. 

The Krag in-game is a pretty faithful adaptation to the real rifle while of course playing by the less realistic rules of the Battlefield universe, and we probably won’t see this rifle again in a game that looks this good for several years.]]></description>
