					<description><![CDATA[I would suggest playing conquest on a server that has an extended amount of tickets. Gives u a longer time frame to complete the second task since you only need one done. Secondly Don&#039;t fully commit to defending objectives and such considering your main goal is getting the gold cosmetic, prioritize on pushing into enemy objectives from the backlines and taking them out one by one. slowly and surely the kills will stack and you&#039;ll get the mission done before the game ends.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would recommend focusing on the one round challenge instead of one life because itâ€™s so much more doable. Find either a conquest or breakthrough match and start grinding. Thereâ€™s really no trick to these challenges just gotta get the kills]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Try hardcore servers bro. In community games. Youâ€™ll have a better chance to stack kills if you just play it right and dont rush or push the open spaces ever. Stay behind cover, wait it out. Youâ€™ll catch those kills in no time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For your information: the Sturmgewehr 1-5 is one of the best weapons in the game and most used in competitive Battlefield :) so no, it isn&#039;t weak. You must know, however, that it is a jack of all trades, master of none. It is best used at medium range. If need be it can hold its own in close quarters, but will of course lose to submachine guns there. Use cover, avoid fighting in the open. Good luck!]]></description>
